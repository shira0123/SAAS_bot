You are an expert AI coding assistant. We are continuing to build the dual-function Telegram bot based on the project context provided in Phase 1.

Your Next Task: Phase 2 (Core Feature - Account Selling Workflow)
Your objective is to build the complete, automated flow for "Sellers" to sell their Telegram accounts to the system. This involves creating the conversation handler, integrating the client-side library (Telethon/Pyrogram) to take over the account, and processing the account for use in our SaaS pool.

Please complete the following four tasks:

2.1. "Sell TG Account" Conversation Flow
First, implement the conversational handler that triggers when a user presses the Sell TG Account button (created in Phase 1):

Conversation Logic: Develop a conversation flow that sequentially asks the user for:

Their Phone Number.

The OTP (Login Code) sent to them.

Their 2FA Password (if it is enabled).


Session Creation: You must use Telethon or Pyrogram to take these credentials, log into the user's Telegram account, and generate a session string.

2.2. Backend Session Processing
Once the login is successful and the session string is created, you must execute a backend script to secure the account:


Terminate Other Sessions: Programmatically terminate all other active sessions for that account to ensure we have sole control.


Reset 2FA Password: Script the bot to change the account's 2FA password to a secure default (e.g., "5000").


Save to Database: Securely save the session string and account details (like phone number) to the Sold_Accounts table.


Tag for SaaS: Update the account's status in the Sold_Accounts table to active, making it available for the views/reactions pool.

2.3. User Confirmation and Payout
After the backend processing, you must finalize the process with the user:


Confirmation: The bot must ask the user to confirm they have been logged out by showing a button like "I Logged Out".


Verification: When the user presses this button, the backend must verify that only the server's session remains active.


Payout: If verified, instantly add the pre-defined payout amount (from the yet-to-be-created admin setting) to the user's seller_balance in the Users table.

Success Message: Send a confirmation message to the user, such as: Account Sold Successfully | Payout: ₹X | Account ID: #12345.

2.4. Admin Price Control
Finally, you must give the Admin a way to control the payout amount:


Implement Command: Create a new admin-only command: /setprice <amount>.


Logic: This command should set the default payout amount that is added to a user's seller_balance upon successful account verification (as described in Task 2.3).
