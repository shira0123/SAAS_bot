You are an expert AI coding assistant. Your task is to help me build a complex, dual-function Telegram bot.

Project Context
What We Are Building
We are creating a sophisticated Telegram bot that operates as a two-sided marketplace.

Seller Side: The bot will automatically purchase Telegram accounts from users ("Sellers"). Users will be guided through a flow to submit their phone number and login codes, and upon successful session capture, they will be paid to an in-bot balance.

Buyer (SaaS) Side: The bot will use this acquired pool of accounts to run a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business. "Buyers" can purchase plans to receive automated views and reactions on their channel posts, which will be delivered by the accounts we collected.

Target Audience
"Sellers": Telegram users who want to earn money by selling their accounts to the system.

"Buyers": Telegram channel owners and administrators who want to purchase engagement (views, reactions). This also includes "Resellers".

"Admins": The operators (us) who will manage the system, set prices, approve withdrawals, and monitor the account pool.

Primary Goal
The purpose is to create a fully automated business. We will buy a resource (Telegram accounts) and use it to sell a service (engagement). The bot must automate account acquisition, seller payouts, buyer payments, and service delivery.

Your Next Task: Phase 10 (Global Admin Reporting & Final Polish)
Your objective is to consolidate all admin reporting into one place, implement the final notification and broadcast systems, and create a comprehensive daily report.

Please complete the following four tasks:

10.1. SaaS Admin Reporting
First, build the comprehensive reporting section for the SaaS (buyer) side of the bot:

Payments & Reports: Create a menu for admins to list all payments, filter them by gateway (UPI, Crypto, etc.), and show revenue summaries (Today, Week, Month).

Sales & Usage Stats: Implement a section to show sales data (Today, Month, Lifetime) and service delivery summaries.

Export Reports: Add a function for the admin to export sales or user data as a CSV file.

10.2. Consolidated Notification System
Implement the complete, system-wide notification logic for all events:

Admin Notifications: Trigger alerts for: New Deposit, New Plan Purchase, Referral Sale, Reseller Sale, and all Withdrawal Requests.

Referral Notifications: Notify users when they earn a commission and when their referral withdrawal is approved.

Reseller Notifications: Notify resellers of a new order via their link and when their commission withdrawal is approved.

User Notifications: Ensure alerts are sent for: Payment success, plan activation, and plan expiry reminders.

10.3. Broadcast & Admin Management
Build the tools for mass communication and admin role management:

Broadcast Message: Implement a command for admins to send a message to different user segments: All Users, Active Buyers, Expired Buyers, and Resellers.

Admin Management: Create the panel for the root admin to manage other admins:

Add/Remove Admin

Assign Roles

View Admin Logs

10.4. Final Daily Reports (Scheduled)
Finally, upgrade the daily report from Phase 4.4 to be all-inclusive:

Combine Reports: Modify the scheduled nightly job to combine all reports into one comprehensive message for the admin.

Report Contents: The message must include:

SaaS Sales & Deposit Summary (Today's revenue).

Seller Account Stats (Today Added/Banned).

TG Account Pool Status (Total, Active, Banned).
